I went through all of the chapters, but I'll be honest, some of them were voodoo jive and I didn't understand them at all.
My goal was to gain a better understanding of Machine Learning using Python. I already know how to do statistical analyses using SPSS, so I'm not
overly impressed creating models in Python to do logistic regression or other stat 101 material.

Hopefully there will be more information on deep learning and image recognition later.
